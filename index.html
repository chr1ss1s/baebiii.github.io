        <h2>A Letter To You</h2>
        <p> Baebiii, I wrote this letter by the time it was almost our 2 month anniverary (it probably already is). Remember that time you told me that your past relationships never made it past 2 months, and that you were scared tht the same would happen once again? Well, I took it as my mission to make it happen, even though there was nothing worng with us, and here we are.<br>I've always wondered why you have the thoughts or expectations, the doubt that we wouldn't last, believe me I've had them too, and its not easy overcoming them by yourself. Apart from believing in us, I see us in unimaginable place, I see us going places where I thought we wouldn't go, I see a future. And I want you there. I want you with me. I believe in us. And I believe in you.
